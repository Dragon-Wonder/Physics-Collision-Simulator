# Cannon-Simulation-Ruby

A really simple program that simulates a cannon ball being fired.

I orginally wrote this in C++ using the SDL Library because I wanted to test that.

This branch is written in ruby because when I was learning it, I wanted to do something more with with so I decided to write this in Ruby.

There are a few branches of this that use different programming languages.

It has been released in the Public Domain meaning you can use it however you wish.
