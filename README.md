# Cannon-Simulation

A really simple program that uses SDL library to simulate a cannon ball being fired.

I used to to test the waters on using SDL for graphics. Putting it on GitHub so that I may easily reference it later.

There are a few branches of this that use different programming languages.

It has been released in the Public Domain meaning you can use it however you wish.

I may or may not update this; because as I've said I'm trying to just put the random code bits I've made throughout the years all on GitHub as a central place to be able to reference them.

# Running the program

You will need to download the images folder. A zip should be included with every release.

Extract this so that the images folder is in the same place as the exe.

In order to run the program properly you will need to download SDL2-2.0.3 or higher.
