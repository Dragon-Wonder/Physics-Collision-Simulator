# SDL-Cannon-Simulation
A really simple program that uses SDL library to simulate a cannon ball being fired.

I used to to test the waters on using SDL for graphics. Putting it on Github so that I may easily refrence it later.

It has been released in the Public Domain meaning you can use it however you wish.
