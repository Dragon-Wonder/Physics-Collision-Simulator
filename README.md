# Cannon-Simulation

A really simple program that uses SDL library to simulate a cannon ball being fired.

I used to to test the waters on using SDL for graphics. Putting it on GitHub so that I may easily reference it later.

There are a few branches of this that use different programming languages.

It has been released in the Public Domain meaning you can use it however you wish.

# Running the program

In order to run the program properly you will need to download SDL2-2.0.3 or higher AND SDL2-image (these are two different libraries). 

A link for SDL2 can be found [here] (https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).

A link for SDL2 image can be found [here](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) .

You will want to download the Runtime Binaries (if you have windows I recommend 32 bit over 64 bit; even if you have a 64 bit computer).

When all is said and done you should have the following files in your folder. (Also note that you should be able to put the dll files in your C drive).

```
FolderName\
FolderName\Cannon.exe
FolderName\SDL2.dll
FolderName\SDL2_image.dll
```

Let me know if I am missing a dependences that I might have forgotten about due to my own system set up.
